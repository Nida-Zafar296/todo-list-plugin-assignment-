## Motivation

The To-Do List Plugin enhances productivity by providing an easy-to-use task management tool within WordPress. It includes user authentication to ensure personalized task organization. This plugin simplifies task management and improves user experience, demonstrating your skills and commitment to practical WordPress plugin development solutions.

## Framework

1. **WordPress**: Core platform for creating and managing plugins.
2. **PHP**: Server-side scripting language used for backend functionality and plugin logic.
3. **JavaScript**: Enhances user interactivity and handles AJAX requests for dynamic updates.
4. **AJAX**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between the client and server, improving user experience.
5. **CSS/SASS**: Used for styling the frontend forms and interface of the plugin.
6. **MySQL**: Database management system for storing user data and to-do list entries.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Registration and login functionality with validation and security measures.
2. **AJAX Integration**: Asynchronous updates for login, registration, and to-do list management without page reloads.
3. **Personalized To-Do Lists**: Users can view and manage their own tasks, with personalized lists displayed after login.
4. **Shortcodes**: Easy integration of forms and lists into WordPress pages and posts.
5. **API**: The WordPress REST API provides endpoints for fetching, adding, and updating a user's to-do list tasks with authentication checks to ensure only logged-in users can modify their tasks.
6. **WP-CLI**: Command class (`WP_Todolist_CLI_Command`) that allows users to manage to-do list tasks by adding, fetching, and updating task status for specific users, with the data stored in WordPress user meta.
